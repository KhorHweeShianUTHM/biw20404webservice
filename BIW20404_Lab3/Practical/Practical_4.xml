<!--
Q4: The Magnificent Enterprise company wishes to save their product 
information in an XML file for record. The situation below can aid in the creation of the XML document .
The root tag will be products. Each product will have its own entry with the 
product id, production date and category. A product can be supplied for either 
overseas or local market Country, distributor, and shipping option will be available for overseas products. 
Then there's the distributor and state for the local productÂ information.
